### Graph_search.java :
Takes a graph (weighted or unweighted) as input and finds the order and path for finding a specific node using uninformed search algorithms
### Solver.java :
Search algorithms (UCS, Best First Greedy, A*) are applied to find the solution to an input N-Puzzle configuration and displays the steps to get the solved board from the original and records the number of puzzle
configurations needed to be compared for the solution to be found
### Solver_blind.java :
Search algorithms (BFS, DFS, DLS, IDS, IBS) are applied to find the solution to an input N-Puzzle configuration and displays the steps to get the solved board from the original
